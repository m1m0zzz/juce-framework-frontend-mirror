mirroring [juce-framework/JUCE/modules/juce_gui_extra/native/javascript](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/master/modules/juce_gui_extra/native/javascript)

## Install

```bash
npm i juce-framework-frontend-mirror@next
```

## This project is not semver.

I gave up semver to match the version with JUCE from which it was mirrored.

And I decided to use the RC (release candidate) version when upgrading for patches.

So please use `npm i juce-framework-frontend-mirror@next` to get the latest version of the package.
